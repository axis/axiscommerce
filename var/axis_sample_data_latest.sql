(40, 1, 'Panasonic HDC-TM300', 'HD images contain 6 times as much information as standard images. HDTV has 1,080 horizontal scan lines, SDTV has 480. That translates into much higher resolution and much finer detail. With HD images on an HDTV, pictures are so clear and sharp that you can see textures. The shift in the industry from SDTV to HDTV is well underway. For shooting once-in-a-lifetime scenes that you want to capture in full beauty, an HD camcorder is the best choice.\n\n3MOS System for Beautiful Images\nFor videos of important moments you want to preserve, you want high image quality. That''s what Panasonic''s 3MOS System delivers, with a combination of optical technologies that further enhance the quality of full-HD images. The 3MOS System produces extremely accurate images with superb rendition of differences in darkness and light, rich color expression, and a full 1,080 lines of horizontal resolution. This advanced technology helps turn once-in-a-lifetime moments into vivid, beautiful images.\n\niA (Intelligent Auto) for Smart Control\nThere''s nothing more disappointing than shooting a once-in-a-lifetime event on video, only to discover that the images are blurry or poorly exposed because of backlighting. Panasonic''s iA helps avoid problems in difficult shooting situations by automatically making the optimal camera settings and activating certain functions. For example, iA now includes AF Tracking, a new function that "locks" on and follows a subject as it moves, so images are sharply focused and properly exposed. This technology is a huge help for everyone.\n\nAdvanced O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilization)\nPanasonic''s advanced O.I.S. helps suppress the effects of hand-shake as you shoot, for both motion and still images. This system uses gyrosensors to detect even tiny amounts of hand-shake, then shifts a lens and adjusts the optical axis to compensate - all at an astounding 4,000 times per second. It also covers approximately 3 times the stabilization area of our previous SD9 model. Because the system is optical, there''s only minimal loss of image quality even when viewed on a large-screen TV. In addition, to shoot high-resolution still images, the normal O.I.S. Mode 1 is joined by an O.I.S. Mode 2, which has a higher stabilization capability. The O.I.S. corrective lens shifts and stabilizes the image the instant that the shutter button is pressed, to enable greater precision in stabilization. You get all the beauty and minimal blurring.\n\nGet Creative - Advanced Functions for Serious Video Shooting\n\nCraft images with intuitive ease: Manual Ring\nThe manual ring gives you easy, fingertip control over the focus, zoom and exposure settings. You''ll find using the ring a much more intuitive, comfortable, user-friendly process than accessing a menu screen. With the manual ring and manual operation, the TM300 is a pleasure to use and gives you the freedom to craft unusually expressive images.\nZoom\nJust rotate the ring to zoom in and out. You have full control of the zooming speed and can zoom in or out to the precise degree you want.\nFocus\nJust rotate the ring to focus. You can focus on the exact point you want, even if it''s not in the center of the frame. You can also change the focus as you shoot, to get the kind of creative shots you sometimes see in movies.\nWhite Balance\nSelect from Auto, Indoor, Outdoor, and White Set according to the location, weather, or type of lighting. You''ll always get the best possible coloring even if the light source changes. *Only when using the EVF.\nShutter Speed\nThe shutter speed can be adjusted from 1/24 to 1/8,000 of a second. Use a high shutter speed when shooting sports events or fast-moving subjects, and you can get clear, sharp, incredible action shots. *Only when using the EVF.\nIris\nUse the ring to adjust the aperture to regulate the amount of light let in. In dim lighting use a lower aperture setting (which corresponds to a larger aperture opening), and in bright lighting use a higher setting. *Only when using the EVF.\n\nA precise way to check the lighting: On-Screen Assist\nZebra Pattern\nA "zebra pattern" is displayed in areas of the frame where the lighting is excessive and the image is over-exposed.\nBrightness Level\nThe light level is metered at the center of the frame and displayed as a percentage (%). This serves as a guide when you''re shooting a subject that''s backlit, or when you want to keep the light level the same even though the lighting conditions change.\nHistogram\nThe histogram displays in graph form the exposure and contrast conditions over the entire frame. This lets you determine fine gradation details that are difficult to tell by just looking at the screen.\n\nTime Lapse Recording\nThe time lapse function uses longer frame intervals than standard shooting. You can use this function to capture shortened or condensed footage of events that actually take place over a much longer time period. For example, time lapse recording is ideal for shooting a flower in the process of blooming, or a long, slow sunset. With time lapse recording, you have an interesting new video technique to explore. *The maximum continuous recording time is 12 hours.', 11, 'Panasonic_HDC-TM300', 'Panasonic HDC-TM300', 'HD images contain 6 times as much information as standard images.

With HTC Tattoo, you don\'t just pick the look, you make the look, by designing your own personal skin for the phone. Next, you decide what really matters to you on your phone. So if you\'re into chatting, texting, and tweeting, you\'ll put all your communication widgets and apps right on your front screen. If you\'re into games, you\'ll visit Android Market and download all the games you want. Put them right on the surface - ready to kill boredom whenever it tries to come out.\n\nStay Close\nDo you have a friend like Jack? Jack â€“ sends you 4 SMS/hour, 3 emails/day, updates his facebook status constantly and uploads pictures on Flickr that you just can\'t miss. With HTC Tattoo staying on top of Jack\'s and your other friends\' lives is dead easy. All you have to do is find a friendly face and your interactions are there, all in one place. So there is no more jumping from one app to another.\n\nDiscover the Unexpected\nSometimes there are no words to describe the cool surprises that happen in your life. Even basic functions like the dialer will make you smile on the HTC Tattoo. You can find a friend by dialing their phone number or simply by dialing their name.\n\nIf you\'re into music, you\'ll love the way you can organize all your tunes by album, artist or by playlists you create. And if you\'re a photo fan, you\'ll rave about the fact that your Album is not just the photos saved on your phone. It is also a gateway to online collections of you and your friends on Facebook or Flickr.\n\nFinding needles in a haystack is no longer a problem with HTC Tattoo. The dedicated Search button sifts through tweets in Twitter?, locates friends in your contact list, finds emails in your inbox, searches through events in the calendar, and scours the web for info.', 9, 'HTC_Tatoo', 'HTC Tatoo', 'HTC Tattoo is all about you.

(40, 2, 'Panasonic HDC-TM300', 'HD images contain 6 times as much information as standard images. HDTV has 1,080 horizontal scan lines, SDTV has 480. That translates into much higher resolution and much finer detail. With HD images on an HDTV, pictures are so clear and sharp that you can see textures. The shift in the industry from SDTV to HDTV is well underway. For shooting once-in-a-lifetime scenes that you want to capture in full beauty, an HD camcorder is the best choice.\n\n3MOS System for Beautiful Images\nFor videos of important moments you want to preserve, you want high image quality. That''s what Panasonic''s 3MOS System delivers, with a combination of optical technologies that further enhance the quality of full-HD images. The 3MOS System produces extremely accurate images with superb rendition of differences in darkness and light, rich color expression, and a full 1,080 lines of horizontal resolution. This advanced technology helps turn once-in-a-lifetime moments into vivid, beautiful images.\n\niA (Intelligent Auto) for Smart Control\nThere''s nothing more disappointing than shooting a once-in-a-lifetime event on video, only to discover that the images are blurry or poorly exposed because of backlighting. Panasonic''s iA helps avoid problems in difficult shooting situations by automatically making the optimal camera settings and activating certain functions. For example, iA now includes AF Tracking, a new function that "locks" on and follows a subject as it moves, so images are sharply focused and properly exposed. This technology is a huge help for everyone.\n\nAdvanced O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilization)\nPanasonic''s advanced O.I.S. helps suppress the effects of hand-shake as you shoot, for both motion and still images. This system uses gyrosensors to detect even tiny amounts of hand-shake, then shifts a lens and adjusts the optical axis to compensate - all at an astounding 4,000 times per second. It also covers approximately 3 times the stabilization area of our previous SD9 model. Because the system is optical, there''s only minimal loss of image quality even when viewed on a large-screen TV. In addition, to shoot high-resolution still images, the normal O.I.S. Mode 1 is joined by an O.I.S. Mode 2, which has a higher stabilization capability. The O.I.S. corrective lens shifts and stabilizes the image the instant that the shutter button is pressed, to enable greater precision in stabilization. You get all the beauty and minimal blurring.\n\nGet Creative - Advanced Functions for Serious Video Shooting\n\nCraft images with intuitive ease: Manual Ring\nThe manual ring gives you easy, fingertip control over the focus, zoom and exposure settings. You''ll find using the ring a much more intuitive, comfortable, user-friendly process than accessing a menu screen. With the manual ring and manual operation, the TM300 is a pleasure to use and gives you the freedom to craft unusually expressive images.\nZoom\nJust rotate the ring to zoom in and out. You have full control of the zooming speed and can zoom in or out to the precise degree you want.\nFocus\nJust rotate the ring to focus. You can focus on the exact point you want, even if it''s not in the center of the frame. You can also change the focus as you shoot, to get the kind of creative shots you sometimes see in movies.\nWhite Balance\nSelect from Auto, Indoor, Outdoor, and White Set according to the location, weather, or type of lighting. You''ll always get the best possible coloring even if the light source changes. *Only when using the EVF.\nShutter Speed\nThe shutter speed can be adjusted from 1/24 to 1/8,000 of a second. Use a high shutter speed when shooting sports events or fast-moving subjects, and you can get clear, sharp, incredible action shots. *Only when using the EVF.\nIris\nUse the ring to adjust the aperture to regulate the amount of light let in. In dim lighting use a lower aperture setting (which corresponds to a larger aperture opening), and in bright lighting use a higher setting. *Only when using the EVF.\n\nA precise way to check the lighting: On-Screen Assist\nZebra Pattern\nA "zebra pattern" is displayed in areas of the frame where the lighting is excessive and the image is over-exposed.\nBrightness Level\nThe light level is metered at the center of the frame and displayed as a percentage (%). This serves as a guide when you''re shooting a subject that''s backlit, or when you want to keep the light level the same even though the lighting conditions change.\nHistogram\nThe histogram displays in graph form the exposure and contrast conditions over the entire frame. This lets you determine fine gradation details that are difficult to tell by just looking at the screen.\n\nTime Lapse Recording\nThe time lapse function uses longer frame intervals than standard shooting. You can use this function to capture shortened or condensed footage of events that actually take place over a much longer time period. For example, time lapse recording is ideal for shooting a flower in the process of blooming, or a long, slow sunset. With time lapse recording, you have an interesting new video technique to explore. *The maximum continuous recording time is 12 hours.', 11, 'Panasonic_HDC-TM300', 'Panasonic HDC-TM300', 'HD images contain 6 times as much information as standard images.

(40, 3, 'Panasonic HDC-TM300', 'HD images contain 6 times as much information as standard images. HDTV has 1,080 horizontal scan lines, SDTV has 480. That translates into much higher resolution and much finer detail. With HD images on an HDTV, pictures are so clear and sharp that you can see textures. The shift in the industry from SDTV to HDTV is well underway. For shooting once-in-a-lifetime scenes that you want to capture in full beauty, an HD camcorder is the best choice.\n\n3MOS System for Beautiful Images\nFor videos of important moments you want to preserve, you want high image quality. That''s what Panasonic''s 3MOS System delivers, with a combination of optical technologies that further enhance the quality of full-HD images. The 3MOS System produces extremely accurate images with superb rendition of differences in darkness and light, rich color expression, and a full 1,080 lines of horizontal resolution. This advanced technology helps turn once-in-a-lifetime moments into vivid, beautiful images.\n\niA (Intelligent Auto) for Smart Control\nThere''s nothing more disappointing than shooting a once-in-a-lifetime event on video, only to discover that the images are blurry or poorly exposed because of backlighting. Panasonic''s iA helps avoid problems in difficult shooting situations by automatically making the optimal camera settings and activating certain functions. For example, iA now includes AF Tracking, a new function that "locks" on and follows a subject as it moves, so images are sharply focused and properly exposed. This technology is a huge help for everyone.\n\nAdvanced O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilization)\nPanasonic''s advanced O.I.S. helps suppress the effects of hand-shake as you shoot, for both motion and still images. This system uses gyrosensors to detect even tiny amounts of hand-shake, then shifts a lens and adjusts the optical axis to compensate - all at an astounding 4,000 times per second. It also covers approximately 3 times the stabilization area of our previous SD9 model. Because the system is optical, there''s only minimal loss of image quality even when viewed on a large-screen TV. In addition, to shoot high-resolution still images, the normal O.I.S. Mode 1 is joined by an O.I.S. Mode 2, which has a higher stabilization capability. The O.I.S. corrective lens shifts and stabilizes the image the instant that the shutter button is pressed, to enable greater precision in stabilization. You get all the beauty and minimal blurring.\n\nGet Creative - Advanced Functions for Serious Video Shooting\n\nCraft images with intuitive ease: Manual Ring\nThe manual ring gives you easy, fingertip control over the focus, zoom and exposure settings. You''ll find using the ring a much more intuitive, comfortable, user-friendly process than accessing a menu screen. With the manual ring and manual operation, the TM300 is a pleasure to use and gives you the freedom to craft unusually expressive images.\nZoom\nJust rotate the ring to zoom in and out. You have full control of the zooming speed and can zoom in or out to the precise degree you want.\nFocus\nJust rotate the ring to focus. You can focus on the exact point you want, even if it''s not in the center of the frame. You can also change the focus as you shoot, to get the kind of creative shots you sometimes see in movies.\nWhite Balance\nSelect from Auto, Indoor, Outdoor, and White Set according to the location, weather, or type of lighting. You''ll always get the best possible coloring even if the light source changes. *Only when using the EVF.\nShutter Speed\nThe shutter speed can be adjusted from 1/24 to 1/8,000 of a second. Use a high shutter speed when shooting sports events or fast-moving subjects, and you can get clear, sharp, incredible action shots. *Only when using the EVF.\nIris\nUse the ring to adjust the aperture to regulate the amount of light let in. In dim lighting use a lower aperture setting (which corresponds to a larger aperture opening), and in bright lighting use a higher setting. *Only when using the EVF.\n\nA precise way to check the lighting: On-Screen Assist\nZebra Pattern\nA "zebra pattern" is displayed in areas of the frame where the lighting is excessive and the image is over-exposed.\nBrightness Level\nThe light level is metered at the center of the frame and displayed as a percentage (%). This serves as a guide when you''re shooting a subject that''s backlit, or when you want to keep the light level the same even though the lighting conditions change.\nHistogram\nThe histogram displays in graph form the exposure and contrast conditions over the entire frame. This lets you determine fine gradation details that are difficult to tell by just looking at the screen.\n\nTime Lapse Recording\nThe time lapse function uses longer frame intervals than standard shooting. You can use this function to capture shortened or condensed footage of events that actually take place over a much longer time period. For example, time lapse recording is ideal for shooting a flower in the process of blooming, or a long, slow sunset. With time lapse recording, you have an interesting new video technique to explore. *The maximum continuous recording time is 12 hours.', 11, 'Panasonic_HDC-TM300', 'Panasonic HDC-TM300', 'HD images contain 6 times as much information as standard images.

After looking at all the reviews and researching everything i could about it i don''t regret buying it. the speed and low light ability of the camera are amazing. I was also very happy to see that all my current lenses worked very well with it, all but my 12x24 that is a dx lens. the over all operation and feel of the D3 is almost identical to the D2x so there is almost no learning curve. Some of the new controls are nice like the D-lighting and ability to customize the sharpness, saturation, and contrast but if you are shooting in raw all the time like i do they mean very little to me. It would have been nice to see a higher resolution camera for Nikon''s first full frame camera but it is still a very high res, high quality camera. the horizon level feature is cool but should have been put in the viewfinder so it could be used during all shooting conditions, it is totally useless for hand held shooting. over all i am very happy with it and i think it is worth every penny.', 'qwerty', 'GREAT CAMERA!', '2009-10-30 20:18:31', 'Amazing low light capability, 11 fps is incredible, very similar to d2x so if upgrading there is almost no learning curve, incredible rear display.', 'should have made their first full frame slr higher resolution, cant see a use for the live view its a total waste to me, the horizon level thing is cool but it should be in the view finder'),

Like you didn''t just bought the SE top smartphone model?! There is no etui nor screen cleaner delivered with it like they use to deliver with P900. No cradle. Just a USB cable aimed for charging and PC communication ... Dissapointed.\r\n\r\nThe loadspeaker gives out a very thin and week sound! There is only one louspeaker installed on this phone and it is positioned on the lower left lateral side of the phone, so as a right handed person you can easily cover it and completely deafen the sound going out from this phone. I had a chance to hear the Nokia E71 phone ringing with it''s default NokiaTune ringtone - it''s fantastic!! That can be called a loadspeaker. And if I''m write, there were two of them on the phone.

(The camera work is well done, backdrops are excellent and the opening scene on the beaches of Normandy is one of the most memorable in cinema history) But the film does suffer from a couple of failings.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is strongly and unapologetically patriotic. The film beings and ends with the American flag, and the in fact, the Americans appear to be the only people in the film. The only appearances from other nationalities are the Germans, and the only character seen is a back-stabbing monster. In contrast, the American soldiers are all rough diamonds, and each death scene for an American character is a tear-jerking moment of sadness.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the plot. After the initial scene, the plot becomes somewhat silly, going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen characters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad of tanks. I really don''t understand how anyone can watch the end of this film with any seriousness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I''d say that the only way this movie deserves the high regard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour, the movie was switched off.

(15, 81, 2, 'approved', 'District 9 is a story about aliens who make contact with Earth and the relationships with humans and society. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa''s District 9. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens'' welfare. Their sole interest, alien technology and weapons. Weapon research would mean huge profits for the company. Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is placed in charge of the filed operation to evict, remove, and place the aliens in a new holding facility. Conflict and tension threaten the operation as agents move in.\r\n\r\nDon''t be fooled. This isn''t your typical alien sci-fi action movie. What got me was the believability. If there were aliens out there that were able to make contact with Earth, it seems it could have gone something like this. The way the perspective switches from mock documentary style to standard third person certainly contributes to it. "Real" news footage and interviewers tell the story in retrospect, as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. I think it all added to the realism of the experience.\r\n\r\nUsually in these type of films, it''s mostly mindless action and the story is lost. Not the case here. There''s so much more to it. It''s also about betrayal, loyalty, trust, relationships, and sacrifice. It can actually be pretty deep and thought provoking with many themes floating around. The film''s really about the story which is really a fresh, gritty, original concept, which is good to see nowadays.\r\n\r\nWhile the creatures can be most readily described as monsters, though they are like us. Family and friendship are still important ideals in their world. The film explores a fine line between human emotions and monsters. With all the selfishness, hatred, and greed within us, maybe we are the real monsters or at least that''s how it can be perceived.\r\n\r\nNeill Blomkamp does a tremendous job with the direction and realism of the film. Sharlto Copley blew me away. I was shocked to see this was his first acting role. The action sequences were well done as well. District 9 is a very unique sci-fi film, one that shouldn''t be missed. Mind you, this isn''t a film for everyone. It''s violent, and many parts can be cringe worthy. Be warned but be ready for one of the best films of the year thus far.
